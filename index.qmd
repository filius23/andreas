<br><br>
I am a sociologist who combines conducting quantitative research with making data accessible through data services and occasional record linkage. My own research focuses on family sociology, including relationship formation and parents’ experiences in the labour market. I also enjoy programming in R and Stata and sharing these skills through teaching.
