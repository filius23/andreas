# Personal website for<br>Andreas Filser

This is the repo for [my personal website](https://afilser.netlify.app/) - welcome! 👋

I keep this repository public so that everyone can learn how to create their own site. This is how I did it. 
Special thanks to [Alison Hill](https://www.apreshill.com) for creating this Hugo Apéro theme and to [Silvia Canelón](https://www.silviacanelon.com) and [Shazia Ruybal-Pesántez](https://shaziaruybal.com/) for publicly providing the code for their pages.
Your site deserves its own unique style. 

My website was made using the [Quarto](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/blogdown/index.html) R package and the [Hugo Apéro theme](https://hugo-apero-docs.netlify.app/).


Feel free to contact me if you have questions! I can't promise I'll be able to help, but I will try.
